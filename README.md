This is a tiny project that uses 
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
to wrap the 
[Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en)
(game engine) web app into a standalone application.

Why? This is so that the kid can use the web-based tool without me having to open up
the whole internet for them. 
I'm using a family safety tool that gives the kid only a limited amount of time for some apps,
namely the browser.
But I also want the kid to have unlimited time for creativity.
Thus, I need Construct 3 to be a standalone app.

**Full disclosure:** 
Absolutely no warranty, no support, no documentation, no time to even explain this project.
I'm making this open source on the off chance that it's useful for someone else out there,
but if you hit a snag, I'm afraid you're on your own.

## Development

Edit:

- Edit the `index.js` file to your liking.
